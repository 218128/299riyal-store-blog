## 1. Xiaomi Smart Band 9 (aka Band 8)
**The King of Budget Trackers**

*Approximate Price: 169 SAR*

The **Xiaomi Smart Band** series is the world's best-selling wearable for a reason. The latest iteration (often sold as Band 8 or 9 globally) brings a massive upgrade: a 60Hz refresh rate screen.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Silky Smooth Screen:** The 60Hz display makes scrolling menus feel fast and fluid, unlike older choppy bands.
*   **Versatile Wearing:** You can wear it on your wrist, clip it to your shoe (Pebble Mode) for running, or wear it as a necklace.
*   **Bright Display:** 600 nits brightness means it's readable even at noon in Riyadh.

### Expert Tip
Buy the "Running Clip" accessory if you are a serious runner. It attaches the band to your laces to track stride length and ground contact time.

## 2. Huawei Band 9
**The Sleep Specialist**

*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*

Huawei has invested millions into their health algorithms. The **Band 9** is less about flashiness and more about clinical accuracy.

### Why Buy It?
*   **TruSleep™ 4.0:** It gives you a detailed breakdown of Light, Deep, and REM sleep, plus a "Sleep Score" every morning. It's shockingly accurate compared to a professional sleep stusdy.
*   **Arrhythmia Analysis:** It can detect signs of A-fib (irregular heartbeat) using its PPG sensor.
*   **Comfort:** The fluoroelastomer strap is soft and sweat-resistant, perfect for wearing to bed.

## 3. Amazfit Band 7
**The Battery Monster**

*Approximate Price: 189 SAR*

Do you hate charging? The **Amazfit Band 7** matches the others on features but beats them on endurance.

### Why Buy It?
*   **18-Day Battery:** With typical use, it lasts nearly three weeks. With "Battery Saver" mode, it can go for a month.
*   **Large Viewable Area:** The screen viewing area is 112% bigger than the previous Band 5.
*   **Alexa Built-in:** You can set alarms and timers with your voice.

## Buying Guide: Fitness Band vs Smartwatch

Many people ask: "Why buy a band when I can get a smartwatch for the same price?"

### 1. Accuracy
At the 200 SAR price point, a **Fitness Band** (like Huawei Band 9) usually has **better sensors** than a cheap smartwatch. The money goes into the health tech, not the big case.

### 2. Comfort
Bands are ultra-light (15-20g). You can sleep with them easily. Cheap smartwatches are often bulky and uncomfortable for sleep tracking.

### 3. Battery
Bands generally last 14+ days. Smartwatches with big screens often last 5-7 days.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Do they count calories correctly?
They provide an *estimate* based on your heart rate and movement. They are consistent (good for tracking progress) but don't treat the number as medical fact.

### Can I swim with these?
Yes! All bands on this list are **5ATM Water Resistant**, meaning they are safe for swimming in pools or ocean (up to 50 meters). They even have specific "Pool Swimming" modes to count your laps.
