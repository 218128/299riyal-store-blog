# Cheapest 5G Smartphones You Can Buy in 2025

5G is no longer just for the rich. STC, Mobily, and Zain have covered most of the Kingdom with insanely fast 5G networks.

If you think 5G is only for expensive flagship phones, think again. In 2025, 5G has become a standard feature even in the budget segment in Saudi Arabia. Whether you are on STC, Zain, or Mobily, you can now enjoy blazing-fast speeds without spending a fortune.

## Why 5G Matters in KSA

In 2025, the price barrier for 5G has crashed. Here are the phones that get you onto the fast lane for the price of a grocery run.

## 1. Itel P55 5G: The Price Breaker
**Approx. Price:** 449 SAR
Itel did the impossible. They made a functional 5G phone for under 500 SAR.
*   **Processor:** Dimensity 6080 (Very decent for gaming too!).
*   **Visuals:** 90Hz Screen.
*   **Compromise:** The camera is average, and charging is slowly (18W).

## 2. Samsung Galaxy A15 5G: The Balanced Choice
**Approx. Price:** 599-650 SAR
If you want a brand you trust, this is it.
*   **Screen:** Super AMOLED (Rare at this price!).
*   **Software:** guaranteed updates for years.
*   **Compromise:** Not the fastest charger in the box (actually, no charger in the box at all).

## 3. Redmi 13C 5G: The Xiaomi Entry
**Approx. Price:** 549 SAR
Xiaomi's offering is solid and dependable.
*   **Build:** Looks very modern with flat edges.
*   **Performance:** Reliable signal reception even in basements.

## Why Do You Need 5G?
1.  **Speed:** 10x faster than 4G.
2.  **Latency:** Better for gaming (lower ping in PUBG).
3.  **Future Proofing:** 4G networks will eventually get slower as carriers focus on 5G.

## Conclusion
If you are buying a phone in 2025 to keep for 2-3 years, **get a 5G phone**. The **Itel P55 5G** is the absolute cheapest entry point, but the **Samsung A15 5G** offers a better screen if you can spend a little more.
