## 1. JBL Go 3
**The "Clip-and-Go" King**

*Approximae Price: 169 SAR*

The **JBL Go 3** features a bold new style and surprisingly rich JBL Pro Sound. It’s so small that you can fit it in your pocket, yet the sound is loud enough to fill a small room.

### Why Buy It?
*   **IP67 Waterproof & Dustproof:** This is a true outdoor speaker. Take it to the pool, the park, or even the shower. It can survive complete submersion in water.
*   **Rugged Design:** The fabric-wrapped body is tough and durable. The integrated loop lets you hook it onto your backpack effortlessly.
*   **Sound Signature:** Punchy bass for its size, with clear vocals.

### Expert Tip
The battery lasts about 5 hours, which is its main weakness. Keep a power bank handy if you're out all day.

## 2. Anker Soundcore 3
**Best Battery Life & Stereo Sound**

*Approximate Price: 249 SAR*

Anker's Soundcore line is legendary for value. The **Soundcore 3** upgrades the fan-favorite Soundcore 2 with better sound and titanium drivers. It is one of the few speakers in this price range offering true stereo sound (two dedicated drivers).

### Why Buy It?
*   **24-Hour Playtime:** You can listen to 480 songs on a single charge. It’s perfect for weekend camping trips where you don't have power.
*   **BassUp Technology:** Anker’s proprietary tech boosts the low frequencies in real-time.
*   **App Control:** Use the Soundcore App to customize the EQ settings—a feature rare in budget speakers.

**Verdict:** If you hate charging your devices, this is the speaker for you.

## 3. Sony SRS-XB13
**Deep Bass in a Tiny Package**

*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*

Sony's **Extra Bass** series is famous for a reason. The SRS-XB13 uses a passive radiator to punch well above its weight in the low-end frequencies.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Multiway Strap:** The versatile strap lets you hang it from a tent pole, wrist, or backpack.
*   **Sound Diffusion Processor:** Spreads sound in every direction, not just straight forward.
*   **Hands-Free Calling:** Has a built-in mic for taking calls, which works surprisingly clearly.

## 4. Tribit XSound Go
**The Audiophile's Secret Budget Choice**

*Approximate Price: 140 SAR*

Tribit is a lesser-known brand that audio enthusiasts swear by. The **XSound Go** offers balanced, clear sound that rivals much more expensive brands like Bose.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Crystal Clear Highs:** If you listen to classical music, jazz, or podcasts, the clarity here is unmatched at this price.
*   **100ft Bluetooth Range:** incredible connection stability.
*   **Value:** It sounds like a 400 SAR speaker but costs less than 150.

## Buying Guide: What to Look For?

### 1. Waterproofing (IP Ratings)
*   **IPX4:** Splash proof (Rain requires caution).
*   **IPX7/IP67:** Fully waterproof (Can be dunked in a pool).
*   *Advice:* For Saudi outdoor use (pools/beaches), always aim for **IPX7** or higher.

### 2. Watts (Volume)
*   **Under 5W:** Good for personal listening (JBL Go 3).
*   **10W - 20W:** Good for a small group or room (Soundcore 3).
*   *Advice:* Don't expect "party" volume from a 3W speaker. You need at least 15W+ to be heard over a noisy crowd.

### 3. Battery Life
Look for at least **10 hours** if you plan to take it out of the house regularly. Bluetooth connection drains battery faster at max volume.
