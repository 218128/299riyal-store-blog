In a world of iPhone 15s and Galaxy S24s, you might be surprised to see shelves at Lulu and Panda stocked with... Nokia phones?
Yes, the humble keypad phone is still a best-seller in Saudi Arabia. But why are people still buying phones that can't even run TikTok? In Saudi Arabia, the keypad phone has carved out a unique niche as the ultimate backup device.
