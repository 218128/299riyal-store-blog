## 1. Logitech C920x Pro HD
**The Universal Standard**

*Approximate Price: 250 - 290 SAR*

The **Logitech C920** series is arguably the most famous webcam in history. It launched a million YouTube relationships. In 2025, it remains the gold standard for reliable, high-quality video under 300 SAR.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Plug & Play:** It works instantly with Zoom, Teams, OBS, and Discord without fiddling with drivers.
*   **Light Correction:** Logitech’s RightLight 2 technology automatically adjusts brightness ensuring you aren't a silhouette even with a window behind you.
*   **Dual Mics:** The stereo microphones capture voice naturally, filtering out some background noise.

### Expert Tip
Download the "Logi Tune" software to manually adjust focus and exposure. The auto-focus is good, but manual control is better for streaming.

## 2. Razer Kiyo (Standard)
**The Streamer's Secret Weapon**

*Approximate Price: 260 SAR*

Lighting is more important than camera resolution. The **Razer Kiyo** knows this, which is why it has a powerful **Ring Light** built right into the lens.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Integrated Ring Light:** Twist the bezel to adjust brightness. It illuminates your face evenly, removing dark shadows under your eyes.
*   **60 FPS Mode:** It can shoot 720p at 60 frames per second. This makes your motion look incredibly smooth, which is crucial for gaming streams.
*   **Autofocus:** Fast and snappy, keeping you sharp as you move around.

**Verdict:** If you stream in a dark room, this is the only webcam you should consider.

## Buying Guide: Webcam Specs Explained

### 1. Resolution (1080p vs 4K)
*   **1080p:** Perfectly fine for Zoom and Twitch.
*   **4K:** Overkill for most users and requires expensive internet bandwidth to stream clearly.
*   *Advice:* Stick to 1080p and save money.

### 2. Frame Rate (30fps vs 60fps)
*   **30fps:** Standard TV look. Fine for meetings.
*   **60fps:** Smooth motion. Great for gaming or fast-talking content creators.

### 3. Field of View (FOV)
*   **78°:** Perfect for one person (head and shoulders).
*   **90°+:** Wide angle. Good for showing a whiteboard or a group of people, but makes your room look messy if it's not tidy.

### Do I need a separate microphone?
For professional calls or streaming, **YES**. While webcam mics have improved, a simple USB microphone (like a Fifine K669) for 100 SAR will sound infinitely better than any built-in webcam mic.

### How do I mount it?
All webcams on this list come with a "Universal Clip" that unfolds to grip the top of your monitor or laptop screen. They also have a standard threaded hole on the bottom to mount on a tripod.
