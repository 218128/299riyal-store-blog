# Best Tablet Accessories Under 299 SAR in 2025 (iPad & Android)

An iPad is just a beautiful screen until you add accessories. With the right tools, it becomes a digital canvas, a laptop replacement, or a cinema.

Official Apple accessories are notoriously expensive (500+ SAR for a keyboard?). We've found the best third-party alternatives that offer 95% of the quality for 20% of the price.

## 1. ESR Rebound Magnetic Case
**The Smart Folio Killer**

*Approximate Price: 80 SAR*

Why pay 300 SAR for Apple's Smart Folio? The **ESR Rebound** mimics it perfectly. It attaches magnetically to the back of your iPad (no plastic shell) for a super slim profile.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Instant On/Off:** The auto wake/sleep function works flawlessly.
*   **Trifold Stand:** Folds into a triangle for two viewing angles: "Typing Mode" (low) and "Viewing Mode" (upright).
*   **Pencil Protection:** A magnetic clasp wraps around your Apple Pencil to keep it from falling off while charging.

## 2. Generic "Palm Rejection" Stylus
**The 600 SAR Apple Pencil Alternative**

*Approximate Price: 90 - 120 SAR*

Unless you are a professional digital artist who needs "Pressure Sensitivity," you **do not** need the official Apple Pencil. Cheap alternatives on Amazon (like Goojodoq or ESR) work almost exactly the same for note-taking.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Palm Rejection:** Rest your hand on the screen while writing. It ignores your hand and only registers the pen.
*   **Tilt Sensitivity:** Shade your drawings by tilting the pen, just like a real pencil.
*   **Magnetic Charging:** Some newer models attach magnetically to the iPad side to charge.

### What You Lose
*   *Pressure Sensitivity:* Pressing harder won't make the line thicker. This matters for art, but not for writing notes.

## 3. Paper-Feel Screen Protector
**For Students & Writers**

*Approximate Price: 40 SAR*

Writing on glass feels slippery and unnatural. A matte "Paper-Feel" protector adds friction, making it sound and feel like you are writing on a notebook.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Control:** Your handwriting will instantly improve because the pen doesn't slide around.
*   **Anti-Glare:** Reduces reflections from overhead lights, making it easier to read ebooks.
*   **No Fingerprints:** The matte texture resists oily smudges.

### Expert Tip
These protectors can wear down your pencil tip slightly faster than glass. Buy replacement tips (cheap).

## Buying Guide: Compatibility Check

### 1. iPad Models
Always check your iPad Model Number (Axxxx on the back) before buying a case. An iPad Air 4 case will NOT fit an iPad Pro 11" perfectly due to camera differences.

### 2. Stylus Compatibility
"Active Stylus" pens generally work on **iPads released after 2018**. They will NOT work on old iPads (like iPad Air 2).

---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will the magnets damage my iPad?
No. iPads are designed with internal magnets specifically to hold these cases.

### Can I use a glass screen protector with a case?
Yes, most cases (like the ESR model) are "case friendly," meaning they leave a tiny gap at the edge so they don't push up the screen protector bubbles.

## Conclusion

*   **For protection:** Buy the **[ESR Rebound Case](#)**.
*   **For students:** Get a **[Generic Stylus](#)** instead of spending 600 SAR on Apple's version.
