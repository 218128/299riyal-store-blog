## 1. Aluminum Laptop Stand
**The Neck Saver**

*Approximate Price: 80 - 120 SAR*

Looking down at a laptop screen puts nearly 60lbs of pressure on your neck. A simple stand raises the screen to eye level.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Ergonomics:** Keeps your spine aligned. You'll feel the difference in your neck after just one day.
*   **Cooling:** Aluminum acts as a heat sink, and the open design increases airflow, keeping your laptop fast.
*   **Aesthetic:** Matches the silver finish of MacBooks and modern Windows laptops.

### Expert Tip
You will need an external keyboard and mouse to use this comfortably, as typing on a raised laptop is awkward.

## 2. Anker PowerExpand+ 7-in-1 USB-C Hub
**The Dongle You Need**

*Approximate Price: 179 SAR*

Modern laptops only have USB-C ports. This hub gives you everything back.

### Why Buy It?
*   **4K HDMI:** Connect to a monitor or TV for presentations.
*   **Power Delivery:** Pass-through charging lets you charge your laptop while using the hub.
*   **SD Card Reader:** Essential for photographers and creators.
*   **Reliability:** Unlike cheap 50 SAR hubs that overheat and disconnect, Anker hubs last for years.

## 3. Logitech M350 Pebble Mouse
**The Silent Traveler**

*Approximate Price: 99 SAR*

Trackpads are great for gestures, but terrible for precision work like Excel or Photoshop. The **Logitech Pebble** is the perfect companion.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Silent Clicks:** It makes 90% less noise than a regular mouse. Use it in a library or coffee shop without annoying anyone.
*   **Dual Connectivity:** Connect via Bluetooth or the stored USB receiver.
*   **18-Month Battery:** Runs on a single AA battery forever.

## Buying Guide: Maximizing Productivity

### 1. Vertical vs Flat Stands
*   **Flat/Angled Stands:** Good for using the laptop keyboard (slightly).
*   **Vertical Docks:** Saves space but requires external monitor + keyboard. Best for small desks.

### 2. Hub Bandwidth
Cheap hubs limit USB speeds to 2.0 (slow). Make sure upgrading to **USB 3.0** (5Gbps) or higher like the Anker we recommended, especially if you move large files.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Do I need a mousepad?
Modern optical mice (like the Logitech Pebble) track on almost any surface, including glass and wood tables. You likely don't need a dedicated mousepad unless you are gaming.

### Will a hub drain my battery?
Yes, a connected hub consumes a small amount of power even when not in use. It is best to unplug it when your laptop is sleeping in a bag.

*   **For connectivity:** The **[Anker 7-in-1 Hub](#)** is the only dongle you need.
