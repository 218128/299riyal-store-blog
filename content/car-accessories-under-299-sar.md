## 1. Anker PowerDrive Speed+ 2
**The Charger That Saves Time**

*Approximate Price: 99 SAR*

Most car USB ports charge at a painfully slow 5W. The **Anker PowerDrive Speed+ 2** pumps out **30W** of power, enough to fast-charge a MacBook Air or bring an iPhone from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Power Delivery (PD):** The dedicated USB-C port handles fast charging for modern phones.
*   **Dual Charging:** Can charge a navigation phone and a passenger's tablet simultaneously without slowing down.
*   **Heat Safety:** Anker’s MultiProtect system prevents overheating, crucial for summer driving.

## 2. 70mai Dash Cam 1S
**The Cheapest High-Quality Insurance**

*Approximate Price: 199 SAR*

Dash cams are becoming essential for proving fault in accidents. The **70mai 1S** (from the Xiaomi ecosystem) is reliable, discreet, and shoots clear 1080p video.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Voice Control:** "Take Picture", "Record Video". Keep your hands on the wheel.
*   **Loop Recording:** Automatically overwrites old footage so you never run out of space.
*   **Night Vision:** Sony Starvis sensors ensure license plates are readable at night.

### Expert Tip
You will need a high-endurance MicroSD card (sold separately ~40 SAR) because standard cards fail in the heat.

## 3. Baseus Magnetic Car Mount
**Simple and Strong**

*Approximate Price: 45 SAR*

Forget those flimsy plastic claws. Magnetic mounts are the way to go. Stick a small metal plate on your phone case, and it snaps onto the mount instantly.

### Why Buy It?
*   **Strong Magnets:** Holds an iPhone 15 Pro Max securely even over speed bumps.
*   **360 Rotation:** Easily spin your phone for map navigation.
*   **Cable Management:** Includes clips to keep your charging cable tidy.

## Buying Guide: Surviving the Heat

### 1. Dashboard vs Vent Mounts
*   **Dashboard (Adhesive):** Better visibility, but the extreme Saudi heat (50°C+) can melt high-quality 3M adhesive over time.
*   **Vent Mounts:** Keeps your phone cool (A/C blows on it), preventing your phone from overheating and dimming the screen during navigation. **We recommend Vent Mounts in summer.**

### 2. Dash Cam Resolution
Don't settle for 720p. You need **1080p minimum** to read license plates. 4K is nice but generates huge files that fill memory cards fast.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will these chargers drain my car battery?
Quality chargers (like Anker) stop drawing power when the car is off. However, some older cars keep the cigarette lighter active 24/7. In that case, unplug it when parking for long periods.

### Are dash cams legal in KSA?
Yes, dash cams are widely used for safety and insurance purposes. However, **do not** use them to film people in private settings or post footage of others online without consent, as this violates privacy laws.
